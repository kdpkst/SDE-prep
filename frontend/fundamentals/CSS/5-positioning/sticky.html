            <h2>History of Microsoft</h2>
            <p>Microsoft was founded by <strong>Bill Gates</strong> and <strong>Paul Allen</strong> on April 4, 1975, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
                Their goal was to develop software for personal computers, starting with a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800.</p>
            <p>In 1980, Microsoft partnered with IBM to provide an operating system for its first personal computer. 
                This led to the creation of <strong>MS-DOS</strong>, which became widely adopted.</p>
            <p>The company's breakthrough came in 1985 with the release of <strong>Windows 1.0</strong>, 
                a graphical user interface built on top of MS-DOS. Over the following decades, 
                Windows evolved into the dominant operating system for personal computers.</p>
            <p>Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Microsoft expanded into productivity software with <strong>Microsoft Office</strong>, 
                gaming with <strong>Xbox</strong>, and web services with <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the 2010s, under CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong>, Microsoft shifted its focus to cloud computing with <strong>Azure</strong> 
                and artificial intelligence. The company also acquired LinkedIn (2016) and GitHub (2018), 
                strengthening its influence in business and software development.</p>
            <p>Today, Microsoft is a global technology leader, innovating in AI, cloud computing, gaming, and enterprise software.</p>
